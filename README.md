# hello-world
first github repository

Testing out the waters of what it means to be on GitHub
I do believe I am going to want to start working on some open-source projects as a low-level coder to begin with

If anyone out there in GitHub land wants to mentor or corraborate with an entry level coder, I have the work-ethic
and drive that can be polished to create a good coder.  I'm creative and hardworking.  I made it this far with some basic 
understanding of coding HTML, CSS, Javascript and Rubyrail.

Ciao for now.
